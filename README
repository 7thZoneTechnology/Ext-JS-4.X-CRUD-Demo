Ext-JS-4.X-CRUD-Demo

Simple MVC CRUD demo for ExtJS 4.X.

Was originally working in ExtJS 4.0.X.

Updated to now work with ExtJS 4.1 beta 2.

This app is a demonstration of ExtJS MVC.  It uses a VERY simple php backend.  The backend uses sessions to manage adds, changes.  Again, this app is intended to demonstrate and learn ExtJS.  I am not trying to show how to create a PHP backend.

The primary working portion of this app is the "Customer Management" section.  You can add and edit customers.

The "Vendor Management" section does NOT work.  You will see a list of vendors.  However, you cannot add or edit vendors.  The "Vendor Management" section is just there to demonstrate the use of a tab panel.
